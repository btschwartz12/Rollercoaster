# Rollercoaster 

## Ben Schwartz

This is a simple C++ project from my high school years that simulates a rollercoaster ride, consisting of the following files:

- `main.cpp`: the main program file, which includes logic for initializing the ride, running the simulation, and displaying the results
- `RollerCoaster.cpp`: defines a `RollerCoaster` class that represents the rollercoaster ride and includes methods for setting up the track and running the simulation
- `Person.cpp`: defines a `Person` class that represents a person riding on the rollercoaster and includes methods for updating the person's state during the ride

Please note that since this was a long time ago, I'm not quite sure of the functionality of the program, but feel free to check it out.
